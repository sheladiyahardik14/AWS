Mongoose OS relies on the AWS CLI you installed locally to use your AWS configuration 'SigV4" credentials to make certificates and a 'thing'
in AWS IoT Core in your account with a shell script. Therefore your AWS CLI region, endpoint, and certificates must all be in the same region, 
and in the same region as the AWS IoT Core console you are using to monitor and test with. Sigv4 consists of a 'User' with their own "Access
key" and "Secret access key". This is normally given to the superuser when you created your AWS Account. However you can make additional
'Users' at any point in AWS IAM. Just make sure any 'User' configuration for the AWS CLI has permissions to full access of AWS IoT Core.
