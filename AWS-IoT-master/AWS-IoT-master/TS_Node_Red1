Troubleshooting Connection Faqs

1.  Make sure you AWS 'Endpoint' region is the same AWS Region as your AWS IoT Core console
as well as  the same region in which you created your device Certificates

2.  Make sure you are outputting on  MQTT(S) Port 8883, and that port isn't being blocked
by your Network Admin

3.  Make sure the network connecting to your device is at 2.4GHz and not 5GHz

4.  Make sure you have activated your device certificates after you downloaded them and that
they are tested and working in your region.

4.  Check the monitor tab in AWS IoT Core to see if you are establishing a connection. 
If the monitor shows you connected to AWS IoT Core but no data is being transmitted
to the AWS IoT 'Test' Console than it most likly is a problem with your Certificates
not being valid, in the wrong region, or being formatted incorrectly
